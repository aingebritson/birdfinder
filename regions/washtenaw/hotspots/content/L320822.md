## How to Bird Here

Nichols Arboretum, affectionately known as "The Arb," is a 123-acre botanical garden and public park owned by the University of Michigan. Its diverse habitats make it one of the best birding spots in Washtenaw County, with over 220 species recorded.

**Spring Migration (April-May)** is the prime season, when warblers, thrushes, and vireos move through in waves. The peony garden becomes a warbler hotspot, with regular sightings of Yellow, Magnolia, Black-throated Green, and Nashville Warblers. The wooded ravines host thrushes including Hermit, Swainson's, and Gray-cheeked.

**Breeding Season (June-July)** brings resident breeders like Red-eyed Vireo, Wood Thrush, Great Crested Flycatcher, and Eastern Wood-Pewee. The prairie restoration area supports grassland birds including Field Sparrow and Indigo Bunting.

**Fall Migration (August-October)** offers a second wave of migrants, though typically quieter than spring. Sparrows become more prominent, with White-throated, White-crowned, and Fox Sparrows in the understory.

**Winter (December-February)** is best for finches, woodpeckers, and winter residents. Look for Red-breasted Nuthatch in the conifers, Winter Wren in dense thickets, and occasional crossbills or Pine Siskins in irruption years.

The Huron River runs along the northern edge, providing habitat for waterfowl, Great Blue Heron, and occasionally Belted Kingfisher. The extensive trail system allows for quiet walking through varied habitats.
